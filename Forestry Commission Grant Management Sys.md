Forestry Commission Grant Management System Specification

Scalable Platform for Defra Blended Finance Contract Management

Executive Summary
This specification outlines a comprehensive grant management system for the Forestry Commission's England Woodland Creation Offer (EWCO) that can scale to underpin Defra's broader blended finance contract management database. The system will modernize woodland creation grant processing while establishing the foundational architecture for managing public-private co-investment across Britain's land use transformation initiatives.

ey Outcomes:

Streamline EWCO grant processing from 12-20 weeks to under 8 weeks
Enable digital-first applications with 90% automation for low-sensitivity areas
Provide real-time tracking and transparency for all stakeholders
Scale to manage £40bn+ in blended finance contracts across Defra
Support government targets to increase tree cover from 14.5% to 16.5% by 2050


1. Current State Analysis
1.1 England Woodland Creation Offer Overview
The England Woodland Creation Offer (EWCO) supports the establishment of new woodlands and is administered by the Forestry Commission. It is funded through the Nature for Climate Fund to support projects that will help us achieve Net Zero by 2050, as well as helping nature recovery. Landowners, land managers and public bodies can apply to EWCO for support to create new woodland, including through natural colonisation, on areas as small as 1 hectare. You could receive up to £10,200 per hectare, plus up to an additional £12,700 in stackable payments when delivering wider benefits to society, nature recovery and the environment.

1.2 Current Process Challenges
Processing Times: Funding decisions can take 12 to 20 weeks from receiving a valid application.
Manual Workflows: Applications require extensive manual review, paper-based mapping, and multiple stakeholder coordination across Forestry Commission, Natural England, and other agencies.
Limited Integration: Current systems lack integration with Land App's EWCO Checker Tool and other digital planning platforms already in use by landowners.
1.3 Land App Partnership Context
Land App has created the EWCO Checker Tool in partnership with the Forestry Commission, which allows landowners and managers to easily plan where they might integrate trees on their land. It highlights where they could benefit from additional stackable payments from the Forestry Commission's flagship grant.
